#
# The MVME2307 BSP
#
# This BSP uses the bootloader's network autoboot to boot the board. It
# does nothing but sleep for the test's timeout period.
#
# You need to:
#
#  1. Set up a TFTP server and provide a suitable path to copy the
#     bootable image to.
#
#  2. Use the `env` command to enable network autoboot:
#       Network Auto Boot Enable [Y/N]           = N? y
#
#  3. Provide a script to power cycle the board
#
#  4. Provide a telnet connection to the serial port
#
#  5. Create a script that converts the executable to the
#     bootable image and copy the image to the TFTP server.
